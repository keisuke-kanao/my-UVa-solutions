My solutions for the problems from UVa Online Judge  
As a software engineer, I've been working for over thirty years. Still, I'm an active programmer and write codes on my own.  
I've been submitting C++/JAVA solutions to UVa Online Judge since Oct., 2010.  
As of now (2018-01-09),  I solved 1,645 problems and my ranking is 58.
